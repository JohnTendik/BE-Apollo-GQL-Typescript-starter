# BE-Apollo-GQL-Typescript-starter

Apollo server, graphql, typescript, node backend starter project. This project is a good starting point for quick mvps

### Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with your choice of package manager ie: `npm i`
3. for development: `npm run dev` alternatively for starting in prod, `npm run start`

In development environment you will have access to GraphQL playground to test out your endpoints with ease. In production, that will be disabled.

This project is setup with example GQL queries and mutations in the form of Books and Authors. This is a good starting point because it is setup in a way that separates resolvers and data into smaller chunks

```
src
  | gql
    | data
      | authors.graphql
      | books.graphql
    | resolvers
      | authorsResolver
      | booksResolver
```

This project also makes use of Typescript, GQL types are automatically generated everytime you run the development script `npm run dev`, but they can be manually generated by running `npm run types:generate`

```
import {
  MutationAddBookArgs,
  AddBookMutationResponse,
} from "../../__generated/graphql";
```
